"""
We are using the two-pointer approach here. First, we assign the left pointer to index 0 and the right pointer to index n-1.
While `left` is less than `right` (pointers donâ€™t cross):
- Calculate the total of the values at the left and right pointers.

**Case 1 (Best Case):**
If the sum of index 0 (`left`) and index n-1 (`right`) equals the target, simply return `left + 1` and `right + 1`.

**Case 2:**
When the total is less than the target, increase the left pointer by 1 because the array is sorted in ascending order.

**Case 3:**
When the total is greater than the target, decrease the right pointer by 1.
